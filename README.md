# TicTacToe
It is a simple,two-player game that,if played optimally by both players,will always result in a tie.
The game is also called noughts and crosses or Xs or Os.
Here,each player picks one X/O in turn and to win,a player must select three words with the same letter.
Xs/Os are put in such a way that a three-in-a-row line(diagonally as well) wins.
